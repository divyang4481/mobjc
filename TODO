* Add support for blocks:
	- can a typed function pointer be used in place of a varargs function pointer?
	  think this will work for intel but not ppc
	- will need a thunk for the block* arg
	- maybe the native code can create the block? and users are responsible for hanging onto
	  the delegate? need to copy and then autorelease them
	- might need a Block type so stuff like sheets can be handled
-(BasicBlock)printLater:(NSString*)someObject;
{
	return [[^ {
		NSLog(@"%@: %@", 
			logLevel,
			someObject
		);
	} copy] autorelease];
}
	- can test with NSArray::indexOfObjectPassingTest
	- probably need a native call to get a _NSConcreteStackBlock isa pointer
	- will need an invoke method
	- need to store blocks somehow to prevent the function pointer from being GCed
	   how does this work with stuff like sheets?
	- do we need copy/dispose?
* Experiment with using the native GC:
	- mono doesn't seem to be able to p/invoke dll's compiled with -fobjc-gc-only...
	  need to try this again when mono stops using boehm
	- compile the native glue with -fobjc-gc-only
	- provide Register and Unregister methods that take an id and stick it in a collection
	- will need a mutex on native side
	- get rid of auto pools (use a define to toggle these on and off)
	- get rid of NSObject::Create
	- get rid of the doRetain ctors
	- get rid of retaincount
	- nsobject should probably not be disposable
	- look at memory unit tests
	- look at app memory test

	static NSCountedSet* s_objects = nil;
	static NSLock* s_lock = nil;
	
	void InitGC()
	{
		s_objects = [[NSCountedSet alloc] initWithCapacity:100];
		s_lock = [[NSLock alloc] init];
	}
	
	void RegisterObject(id object)
	{
		[s_lock lock];
		[s_objects addObject:object];
		[s_lock unlock];
	}
	
	void UnregisterObject(id object)
	{
		[s_lock lock];
		[s_objects removeObject:object];
		[s_lock unlock];
	}

* Need to always generate response files.
* Should be able to call arbitrary .net code from native code.
* Might be nice to have some Smokey rules:
	- if managed class inherits from a managed class, attr and c# classes have to have 
	  the same base
	- subclasses need ExportClassAttribute if a base class has it
* Need to do something with glue packaging. Ideally a universal binary with ppc, intel,
  and 64-bit targets. If not that, then cross compile libs and have instal.sh install the
  right one.
* Think about adding a retain mode.
	public enum RetainMode 
	{
		Normal, 		// NSObject doesn't do any implicit retains
		Exports, 		// if the NSObject's actual type is decorated with ExportClassAttribute then the NSObject ctor does a retain
		All				// the NSObject always does a retain
	}	
* Build a universal glue lib?
* Release checklist:
	- search for TODO (everywhere)
	- run gendarme
	- make sure tests work in debug
	- make sure app works in debug
	- make RELEASE=1 test
	- make RELEASE=1 app
	- make sure app memory test is OK
	- review tar target
	- make sure everything is checked in
	- use svn log -r 1:HEAD > CHANGE_LOG
	- update CHANGES file
	- update version number
	- remove build_num file
	- build debug 
	- install
	- upload new html docs
	- update README and wiki
	- upload a new version to googlecode
	- send an announcement
	- make sure everything is checked in
* Limitations:
	- 64-bit is doable but not there yet (mono doesn't support it either tho)
	- can't export static methods
	- can't add methods to an instance (as opposed to a class)
	- thread safety needs to be tested
	- native subclass of a managed class isn't tested
